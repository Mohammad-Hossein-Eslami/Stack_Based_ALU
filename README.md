# Stack_Based_ALU
In this repository, you can see the code to a stack_based_alu that performs arithmetic operations as well as basic stack operations.



## Tools
For this project, we used the following tools to implement our model
- Visual Studios
- ModelSim

## Implementation Details
To better understand how this model works and what the results are when running the testbench on it, visit Report.pdf to get a completely detailed explanation of the implementation and the results.

## How to Run
To run the code for yourself, you first need to open ModelSim and then open the project on it. 
Later, you need to compile the Verilog files which are in the project.
